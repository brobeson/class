    \frametitle{What does Struck do?}
    Struck provides an adaptive tracking-by-detection framework.

    It directly ties image features to a transformation.

    It eliminates binary labelling with equal weight.

    It uses a structured output SVM, with a boundary on the number of support vectors.

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Where does Struck fall short?}
    Currently, Struck focuses solely on translation.

    Though rotation does not appear to confuse Struck, it's not detected and shown.

    Smeulders et. al. concluded Struck's primary problem was dealing with scale (camera zoom).
