The primary goal of the paper is to improve segmentation of brain tissue in MR
imagery. They accomplish this by improving the EM algorithm frequently used in
MR imagery segmentation. Segmenting MR imagery allows doctors to better analyze
the imagery and focus on the tissue of concern. Manual segmentation is time
consuming; subjective; and difficult, if not impossible, to reproduce. These
issues make manual segmentation impractical for large neurological studies. The
authors point out that the traditional EM algorithm tends to over fit the
training data, and can become focused on local optima. These drawbacks limit the
accuracy of EM. The authors also state that EM is deterministic, implying this
is also a drawback. However, this property seems to me to be an advantage.

The authors make standard assumptions about their data as required by GMM. Brain
MR imagery is composed of volume elements, or voxels. The authors assume that
each voxel represents a single type of tissue; that is, a voxel will not contain
a bit of tissue type 1 and a bit of tissue type 2. For their experiments, the
authors assumed three Gaussian models for the EM and variational EM (VEM)
algorithms.

Two data sets were used for verification and experimentation. The first
consisted of 20 low resolution brain MR images. The second set was 17 high
resolution brain MR images. Both data sets were obtained from The Internet Brain
Segmentation Repository (IBSR). The repository's URL is
http://www.cma.mgh.harvard.edu/ibsr/index.html, though attempts to visit
repository timed out. The authors do not identify which specific data sets they
retrieved from the repository.

The authors compared their GA-VEM algorithm to standard Expectation Maximization
(EM), Variational EM (VEM), and to Genetic Algorithm EM (GA-EM). The GA-EM
algorithm tested was obtained from the MIXTUREGA software package, available at
\\ http://www.cs.tut.fi/~tohkaj/gamixture.html. In addition, the authors
compared their segmentation to that of the software packages Statistical
Parametric Mapping (SPM) and FMRIB Software Library (FSL). The versions of SPM
and FSL used are not specified. SPM is available for download at
http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/ and FLS is available at
https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/. Plots include histograms of voxel
values, particularly a set of histograms comparing the ground truth to the
GA-VEM output. The authors also included sample MR images, colored by tissue
classification. These images allow for visual comparison of the ground truth to
the various algorithms used in the experiments. Line graphs indicate the
classification accuracy of each method on the test images. Box and whisker plots
are used to compare the output accuracy for different initial values of
\(\beta^0\). The metric used for comparing the algorithms is classification
accuracy, specifically the Jaccard similarity coefficient. This is the
intersection of the algorithm output with the ground truth, divided by their
union. The ground truth was obtained from investigators trained in brain MR
image segmentation.

The authors claim that using GA overcomes the difficulty of initializing VEM.
Their GA-VEM algorithm results in more accurate classification than the
alternatives compared in the experiments.

The only issue noted with GA-VEM by the authors is determining the initial value
of the \(\beta^0\) hyperparameter. The authors ran a set of experiments with
different initial values of \(\beta^0\), to evaluate the effect on
classification accuracy. The authors made no mention of ideas for future
improvement.

In my opinion, this paper presents an interesting improvement on EM and VEM. The
genetic algorithm seems like a novel method of initializing the VEM algorithm.
This does involve computational complexity than EM, but it appears to be just a
constant factor; that is, given complexity O(n) for EM, the complexity of GA-VEM
appears to be kO(n). The experimental data set seems a bit small, only 37 MR
images. The results are promising, though. GA-VEM is shown to be more accurate
than EM, VEM, and GA-EM. Against SPM and FSL, GA-VEM is more accurate, or only
slightly less accurate.

\begin{quote}TODO - My Improvement Suggestions\end{quote}

It seems clear that GA-VEM can be applied to any image or video processing tasks
for which EM is used.

em4gmm is a C implementation of the EM algorithm \\
(https://github.com/juandavm/em4gmm). The OpenCV library contains an EM
implementation \\
(http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/ml/doc/expectation\_maximization.html).
