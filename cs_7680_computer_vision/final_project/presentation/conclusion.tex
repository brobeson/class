    \frametitle{Did I make it better?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Clearly not "Yes, everyone should use my Struck!"
        \item In a few cases mine is better: coke11, dollar, surfer, tiger2
        \item In one case, unmodified was the same as originally reported: david
        \item Interesting, in other cases, original reporting was better than unmodified: faceocc, faceocc2, girl,
            tiger1
    \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Future work}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Incorporate velocity and time in the loss and weight functions.
        \item Target specific failings: zooming and complete occlusion.
        \item Tracking via SIFT.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Could use SIFT features instead of Haar, histogram, or raw.
                \item Possibly a different algorithm, using SIFT over the entire frame.
            \end{itemize}
