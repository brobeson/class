\begin{enumerate}
    \item Zhao and Zhang \cite{s111009573} has 47 citations according to Google
        Scholar.

    \item The paper is available at
        http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/11/10/9573/htm.

    \item The authors want the computer to recognize facial expressions in images. Facial expressions are a primary mode of non-verbal communication between people. Thus automating facial recognition has interesting applications for various fields.

    \item 

    \item The authors used the JAFFE database (http://www.kasrl.org/jaffe.html) and the Cohn-Kanade database (http://www.pitt.edu/~emotion/ck-spread.htm).

    \item 

    \item KDIsomap was compared to PCA, LDA, KPCA, kernel linear discriminant analysis (KLDA), and kernel isomap (KIsomap).
    
    Quantitatively, the authors compared each algorithm's recognition accuraccy vs. embedded dimension in a line graph. The authors also provide a table showing each algorithm's peak accuracy with the corresponding embedded dimension. Finally, a confusion matrix is provided for KDIsomap for seven classes of facial expressions.
    
    There are no qualitative figures directly related to KDIsomap.
