These are the original questions to be answered in my summary of each paper.

1. The source of the paper using the IEEE reference style (Authors, Paper Title,
   Journal/Conference Name, Volume Number, Page Number, and Year).
1. The URL of the paper and source code if applicable.
1. The problem to be solved. Why is the investigated problem interesting?
1. The assumptions made by the authors. Explain how the authors use these
   assumptions in their solution. **What is your prediction on the final results
   without these assumption?**
1. Provide the URL of the source of the data set if mentioned in the paper. If
   no URL is provided, please indicate a URL to your knowledge for downloading
   similar data sets.
1. The algorithmic overview (i.e. pseudo-code) of the approach proposed in the
   paper. Please do not copy all the formulas from the paper. Pick out several
   important formulas for the important steps and **summarize each formula
   listed in your report in your one sentences.**
1. The results compare to others. Qualitatively, what kind of plots or figures
   are used for comparison? Quantitatively, what kind of performance metric(s)
   and/or statistical tests are used for comparison?
1. Shortcomings of the approach and future improvement **mentioned in the
   paper.**
1. Your evaluation of the paper in terms of the **technical novelty,
   computational complexity,** and **experimental results.**
1. Your suggestions about the possible improvement to solve the problem. **Based
   on your suggestions, can any assumption be eliminated?**
1. Your thoughts about applying the proposed techniques to other applications.
