This is a review of "System for Hyperspectral Data Analysis, Visualization and Fresco Deterioration Detection" by Lu et al. [1] The paper attempts to help humans visualize features of hyper-spectral images to locate damage in art frescos. The paper doesn't seem to innovate new techniques; it combines existing techniques. Data reduction and analysis algorithms employed are principal component analysis (PCA), and K-means clustering. Visualization techniques are basic: contour plots, scatter plots, and line graphs. The data set is not identified in the paper. The output of the authors' process is compared to known values for the same data and show their process works, at least for this case. The authors' implementation was built for MS Windows, but it's not clear what programming language was used. Overall, this does not appear to be a very innovative paper.
