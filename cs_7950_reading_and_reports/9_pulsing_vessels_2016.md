This is a review of "Pulsing Blood Vessels: A Figurative Approach to Traffic Visualization" by Cruz and Machado. [1] The article presents an overview of two visualizations of traffic conditions. The first involves modelling the roads as blood vessels and the traffic as blood cells. The roads grow and shrink in width as traffic is added to the road. The second visualization distorts the map, increasing road length as travel time decreases. Finally, the authors combine the two techniques into one visualization animation. The data used were 1,534 vehicles travelling around Lisbon for a month, and 141 vehicles travelling around London for a month. The Lisbon data was provided by MIT Portugal CityMotion; it's unclear if that data is publicly available. The London data was provided by eCourier (http://www.ecourier.co.uk). I think this data was all GPS data; thus no video or imagery analysis would be necessary. The article mentions no evaluation methods, verification methods, or comparisons to other techniques. The article does point out that distorting the map necessarily distorts the data. The advantage, typically, is that presenting a spatial visualization is inherently understandable to users, particularly when they are familiar with the geographic area in question. However, I found the distortion animations to be quite distracting (the authors make their animations available on http://www.vimeo.com and refer to the videos in the article).
