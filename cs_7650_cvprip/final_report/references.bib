abstract={There is a large variety of trackers, which have been proposed in the literature during the last two decades with some mixed success. Object tracking in realistic scenarios is a difficult problem, therefore, it remains a most active area of research in computer vision. A good tracker should perform well in a large number of videos involving illumination changes, occlusion, clutter, camera motion, low contrast, specularities, and at least six more aspects. However, the performance of proposed trackers have been evaluated typically on less than ten videos, or on the special purpose datasets. In this paper, we aim to evaluate trackers systematically and experimentally on 315 video fragments covering above aspects. We selected a set of nineteen trackers to include a wide variety of algorithms often cited in literature, supplemented with trackers appearing in 2010 and 2011 for which the code was publicly available. We demonstrate that trackers can be evaluated objectively by survival curves, Kaplan Meier statistics, and Grubs testing. We find that in the evaluation practice the F-score is as effective as the object tracking accuracy (OTA) score. The analysis under a large variety of circumstances provides objective insight into the strengths and weaknesses of trackers.},

abstract = "Abstract Image retrieval is an active research area in image processing, pattern recognition, and computer vision. Relevance feedback has been widely accepted in the field of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) as a method to boost the retrieval performance. Recently, many researchers have employed support vector machines (SVMs) for relevance feedback. This paper presents a fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) that is more robust to the four major problems encountered by the conventional SVMs: small size of samples, biased hyperplane, over-fitting, and real-time. To improve the performance, a dominant color descriptor (DCD) is also proposed. Experimental results based on a set of Corel images demonstrate that the proposed system performs much better than the previous methods. It achieves high accuracy and reduces the processing time greatly."

abstract = {This paper proposes a new algorithm for training support vector machines: Sequential Minimal Optimization , or SMO . Training a support vector machine requires the solution of a very large quadratic programming (QP) optimization problem. SMO breaks this large QP problem into a series of smallest possible QP problems. These small QP problems are solved analytically, which avoids using a time-consuming numerical QP optimization as an inner loop. The amount of memory required for SMO is linear in the training set size, which allows SMO to handle very large training sets. Because matrix computation is avoided, SMO scales somewhere between linear and quadratic in the training set size for various test problems, while the standard chunking SVM algorithm scales somewhere between linear and cubic in the training set size. SMO's computation time is dominated by SVM evaluation, hence SMO is fastest for linear SVMs and sparse data sets. On real- world sparse data sets, SMO can be more than 1000 times faster than the chunking algorithm.},

abstract="In this paper a novel approach to fuzzy support vector machines (SVM) in multi-class classification problems is presented. The proposed algorithm has the property to benefit from fuzzy labeled data in the training phase and can determine fuzzy memberships for input data. The algorithm can be considered as an extension of the traditional multi-class SVM for crisp labeled data, and it also extents the fuzzy SVM approach for fuzzy labeled training data in the two-class classification setting. Its behavior is demonstrated on three benchmark data sets, the achieved results motivate the inclusion of fuzzy labeled data into the training set for various tasks in pattern recognition and machine learning, such as the design of aggregation rules in multiple classifier systems, or in partially supervised learning.",
